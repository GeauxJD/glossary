"The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) provides a way to capture the principal characteristics of a vulnerability and produce a numerical score reflecting its severity. The numerical score can then be translated into a qualitative representation (such as low, medium, high, and critical) to help organizations properly assess and prioritize their vulnerability management processes."

The [FIRST](https://www.first.org/cvss/) CVSS SIG gathers feedback to
improve the CVSS.

CVSS provides a simple estimate of a vulnerability's
severity from a few principal characteristics. However,
the ultimate importance to an organization of some software
vulnerability depends on many details of exactly how the software is
used; no simple system like CVSS can fully capture this.
Many find CVSS helpful (since there are *many* known vulnerabilities).
However, do not assume that a vulnerability with a critical severity is *always*
truly critical to your organization, and do not assume that a vulnerability
with medium severity *always* less important to your organization.
