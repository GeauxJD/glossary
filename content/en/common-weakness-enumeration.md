"Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE™) is a community-developed list
of common software and hardware weaknesses. A “weakness” is a
condition in a software, firmware, hardware, or service component
that, under certain circumstances, could contribute to the introduction
of vulnerabilities."

Examples of CWEs are:

* "Improper Neutralization of Input During Web
  Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')" (CWE-79),
* "Out-of-bounds Write" (CWE-787)
* "Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command
  ('SQL Injection')" (CWE-89)

Each CWE identifies a *type* of vulnerability.
A specific vulnerability in a specific product, once publicly known,
would receive a *CVE* identifier (not a CWE identifier).
