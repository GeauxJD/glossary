"Security hardening is the process of enhancing the security posture
of a system or network by implementing a series of proactive measures
to reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate potential risks. This includes
configuring systems, applications, and infrastructure to adhere to
best security practices, such as disabling unnecessary services,
enforcing strong authentication mechanisms, applying patches and
updates regularly, and configuring firewalls and intrusion detection
systems. The goal of security hardening is to minimize the attack
surface and strengthen defenses against cyber threats, reducing the
likelihood of successful attacks and enhancing overall resilience
to security breaches and unauthorized access."

Some definitions are narrower, for example,
[NIST SP 800-152](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/hardening)
defines hardening as
"a process intended to eliminate a means of attack by patching vulnerabilities and turning off nonessential services."
However, even if it doesn't *eliminate* some means of attack, we consider 
processes that reduce vulnerabilities and mitigate potential risks as
hardening.
