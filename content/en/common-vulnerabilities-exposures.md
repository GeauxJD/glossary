A list of publicly disclosed computer security flaws. When someone refers to a CVE, they mean a security flaw assigned a CVE ID number. The mission of the CVE Program is to identify, define, and catalog publicly disclosed cyber security vulnerabilities. There is one CVE Record for each vulnerability in the catalog. The vulnerabilities are discovered then assigned and published by organizations from around the world that have partnered with the CVE Program. Partners publish CVE Records to communicate consistent descriptions of vulnerabilities. Information technology and cybersecurity professionals use CVE Records to ensure they are discussing the same issue, and to coordinate their efforts to prioritize and address the vulnerabilities.
