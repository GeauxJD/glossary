An adjacent attacker is an attacker who can exploit a vulnerability by accessing a vulnerable component from a short-range network, such as Bluetooth. The attack must be launched from the same physical or logical network as the vulnerable component.

The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) uses the attack vector metric to evaluate how easily a vulnerability can be exploited. The attack vector metric has four levels: 
- Adjacent (A): The attacker can only exploit the vulnerability through a shared physical network. 
- Local (L): The attacker can exploit the vulnerability locally or remotely, or by tricking a user into helping. 
- Network (N): The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, up to the internet. 
- Physical (P): The attacker must physically interact with the target system.
