# OpenSSF Glossary

This project is a work in progress to create a glossary intended to be used as a reference for common terms when talking about OpenSSF and open source software security.

The code for this project is cloned from the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Cloud Native Glossary Project hosted at [https://glossary.cncf.io/](https://glossary.cncf.io/). using CNCF's [instructions for creating your own glossary](spin-new-glossary.md).

The list of terms we are working on is listed in
[OpenSSF Glossary Proposed Terms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1enqUOHrTpbX3PMAx6tWIdceT5cB-7sVRXeb60-L71U0/edit?tab=t.0).
