# OpenSSF Glossary

This project is a work in progress to create a glossary intended to be used as a reference for common terms when talking about OpenSSF and open source software security.

The code for this project is cloned from the the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) Cloud Native Glossary Project hosted at [https://glossary.cncf.io/](https://glossary.cncf.io/). using CNCF's [instructions for creating your own glossary](spin-new-glossary.md).
